            <h3>From: Sasori To: Fife and Orla</h3>
			<p>To those who have uncovered my secret laboratory, It seems fate has interwoven our paths more intricately than I initially anticipated. I confess, I did not realize that my role was meant to be one of aiding you through the trials and tribulations that lay before you. However, destiny has a peculiar way of revealing its intentions, and it appears that our destinies have become entwined. I commend your tenacity and resourcefulness in uncovering the truth. You have proven yourselves to be formidable allies, and I look forward to witnessing your growth in power and influence. The challenges you face will undoubtedly shape you into formidable forces that can bring about change in this realm.	As you delve deeper into the mysteries that surround us, remember that strength is not solely defined by one's abilities but by the choices made along the journey. May your path be illuminated by knowledge and guided by wisdom. Embrace the trials that lie ahead, for it is through adversity that we truly grow. Until our paths cross again,</p>
