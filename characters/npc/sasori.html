                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>Sasori is an idealistic and ambitious young adult who rose to power in Cledo through manipulation and deals with dark forces. A man in his late 20s to early 30s with short black hair and a well-groomed appearance. He is tall and lean, with sharp features and piercing green eyes. Sasori often wears fine clothing, usually in muted colors, and carries himself with an air of confidence and authority.  Sasori is not afraid to take bold actions if he believes they are in the best interest of his constituents, even if it means going against the established norms or traditions.</p>
				</br>
				<p>Sasori speaks in a measured and confident tone, carefully choosing his words to convey his meaning. He tends to be reserved and serious in his demeanor, but he can be friendly and approachable when he wants to be</p>
				</br>
				<h3>Interactions</h3>
				<h4>Meeting Orla and Fife</h4>
				<p>Sasori had welcomed Orla and Fife into the city with open arms. Bestowing gifts upon the party and even inviting them to a masquerade ball.</p>
                </br>
				<h4>Toxic Arcanium</h4>
				<p>Toxic Arcanium is a byproduct of Sasori's work in producing magical Items through the process of pulling life essence from the already terminally ill. The results of this process produced a magical pollutant that would give a person arcane ability at the cost of a progressively worsening sickness. The cure to neutralize this was developed by Antoine Von Barentone. After the party had revealed that Sasori was the source of the Toxic Arcanium he had fled Cledo to avoid arrest.</p>
				</br>
				<h4>A Sprung Trap</h4>
				<p>Upon the party's return from the capital Kleah Sasori had fled and left a note for the players.</p>
