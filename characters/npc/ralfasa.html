                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>Little is known about Ralfasa other than he has been heard of in other realities. As of right now he is a prominent general to Lord Dispater due to his unique tactics for the blood war. He also appears to be manipulating the strings of fate that seems related to the party's journey for unkown reasons.</p>
                <h3>Interactions</h3>
				<h4> History With Brutus </h4>
				<p>Long before current events Ralfasa had made a deal with Brutus. This deal allowed Brutus to keep a portion of souls from his foes that have been slain and allowed to exchange those souls for various boons</p>
				</br>
				<h4> The Ember King's Contract </h4>
				<p>A Contract brokered by Ralfasa between The Ember King and The Ice Fey that represented a tenuous end to the Second Fey War.</p>
				</br>
				<h4> Sasori's Contract </h4>
				<p>Sasori and Ralfasa agreed to a contract granting Sasori divination abilities in exchange for various tributes. This pact also led to Beureguarde's soul being obtained by Ralfasa.</p>
				</br>
				<h4> Sanjo's Contract </h4>
				<p>Sanjo and Ralfasa agreed to a contract granting Sanjo the power and ability to dishonor Kenshin. This resulted in Kenshin's love being killed along with a large number of people in Kenshin's homeland.</p>
				</br>
				<h4> Ralfasa's Underlings </h4>
				<p>Devial and Kel are one of many devils under Ralfasa's command. They begrudgingly do his work wether it's out of fear or loyalty is unkown</p>
				</br>
				<h4> The Infernal Archives </h4>
				<p>For an unkown reason Ralfasa had instructed Kel and Devial to sabotage the protective ritual of the archives.</p>
				</br>
				<h4> The Party </h4>
				<p>After the heist on the archives the party has realised that Ralfasa has impacted everyone's lives to some degree. The party now plans on confronting Ralfasa to get some answers.</p>
