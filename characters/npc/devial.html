                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>An underling to Ralfasa, she enjoys using her natural charisma and natural skills to move up the infernal food chain. She has done so quite quickly relatively speaking and is gunning for Kel's role and position.</p>
                <h3>Interactions</h3>
				<h4> Fife's Summons </h4>
				<p>First introduced at the Wretched Refuge Tavern in The Citadel where she was waiting to attend Fife's Summon. After the party members caught wind of her presence Kenshin and Fife decided to confront Devial and intimidate him into not appearing at the summons the next day. However this plan went astray when Devial had seduced Fife and was willing to make an even better deal for Fife at her summons the next day. Despite Devial's offer not being taken she gave fife a little pendant that allows them to communicate. Devial being very forward with Fife is claiming to play the long game in an attempt to win Fife's soul.</p>
				</br>
				<h4> The Infernal Bazaar </h4>
				<p>Fife having summoned Devial has asked for help in locating Kel's hidden store. She agrees to do so with the stipulation that they eliminate Kel so she can take over his postion. Much to her dismay it doesn't happen.</p>
				</br>
				<h4> In the Infernal Archives </h4>
				<p>Ralfasa had tasked Kel and Devial to sabotage the archives while the players were performing their own heist on the building. Disguised as a pentadrone Devial and Kel had stopped the ritual that would have protected the archives from a catostrophic impact. Devial and Kel had also assisted the players in retrieving the documents that they were looking for and not aware of the trap that was attatched to it.</p>
				</br>
				<h4> Return To Dis</h4>
				<p>Once again Fife has summoned Devial as The City of Dis is descending into chaos after the escapades of The Infernal Archives. Devial looking haggard and disheveled is reluctantly tagging along with the party on their way to The Iron Tower of Dis to confront Ralfasa.</p>
