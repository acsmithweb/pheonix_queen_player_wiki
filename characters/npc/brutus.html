                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p> A Tabaxi from an alternate reality lost in the space-time of the Far Realm, has made his way to the current reality and is attempting to find his way back home so he can help save his world from an insidious lich. He has been residing on God Street in The City Of Dis for some time taking out various contracts and collecting souls from slain foes to further his purposes of getting home.</p>
                </br>
                <h3>Interactions</h3>
                <p> Brutus had caught wind of Fife who had attempted to sell her soul to a devil in exchange for Buereguarde's return. Brutus had positioned himself among one of the entities that had a claim to her soul and offered to help her with her dilema. In exchange he wanted information on a particular arch devil and was willing to return Fife's soul back to her once everything was completed.</p>
                </br>
                <p> Kenshin has decided to become a follower of Brutus (somewhat to his dismay).</p>
                <p> It has been revealed that Brutus has a contract with Ralfasa in which various boons used by Brutus are powered by souls from his victims and some are sent to Ralfasa.</p>
