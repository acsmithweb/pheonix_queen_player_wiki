                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>Kel is a devil with expensive and exotic tastes he runs a shop in the Infernal Bazaar called Hej's Haven where he sells blackmarket luxuries and adopts the persona named The King Of Dis. Don't let his flamboyant and submissive demeanor fool you. He can be quite the schemer when he has been slieghted. He uses his position as procurer of illicit goods to leverage favors and knowledge that can be passed along to his boss Ralfasa</p>
                <h3>Interactions</h3>
				<h4> Fife's Summons </h4>
				<p>First introduced at the Wretched Refuge Tavern in The Citadel where he was waiting to attend Fife's Summon. After the party members caught wind of his presence Kenshin and Fife decided to confront Kel and intimidate him into not appearing at the summons the next day. Following the summons Kel was furious and began plotting against the party by sending mysterious messages to them in an attempt to sew distrust among the group.</p>
				</br>
				<h4> The Gardens Of Delight </h4>
				<p>Kel attempted to ensnare the party members by luring them to The Gardens Of Delight hoping they would be lost to the allure of the gardens. However underestimating the mental fortitude of the adventurers he was displeased to see them appear in his store not long after they had visited.</p>
				</br>
				<h4> Awkward Moments </h4>
				<p>In an attempt to get information on the relationship between Brutus and Ralfasa the party tries to seduce Kel by using Kenshin as a distraction. Much to everyones confusion and dismay Kenshin proceeded to stab Kel who interestingly enough did not retaliate and simply walked away in shock.</p>
				</br>
				<h4> In the Infernal Archives </h4>
				<p>Ralfasa had tasked Kel and Devial to sabotage the archives while the players were performing their own heist on the building. Disguised as a monodrone he and Devial had stopped the ritual that would have protected the archives from a catostrophic impact. Kel and Devial had also assisted the players in retrieving the documents that they were looking for and not aware of the trap that was attatched to it.</p>
