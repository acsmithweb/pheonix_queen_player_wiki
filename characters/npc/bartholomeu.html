                <p>A Warforged and unit of the royal battalion Bartholomeu was created towards the end of the Second Fey War. He had participated in one of the most gruesome battles of the time it was known as The Night of the Final Hunt. In which the ice fey had executed an attack on the capitol with a large mass of their forces.</p>
                <h3>Interactions</h3>
				<h4> The Night Of The Final Hunt. </h4>
				<p>A big push unexpected attack from Ice Fey forces on the capitol Kleah. The Fire Fey forces were tasked with defending the city and buy everyone enough time to escape the city. The Fire Fey were successful in holding them off but at a great cost. Both sides had extreme losses. This battle was seen as the last great battle of the war. There were skirmishes and incidences after the fact but they were not close to the scale of this battle.</p>
				</br>
				<h4> The Long Nap </h4>
				<p>Bartholomeu was stored away in the King's Vault and 'powered off'. Done primarily to hide help around in the event his Kin ever come back to reclaim the throne</p>
				</br>
				<h4> Awakening at The Kings Vault</h4>
				<p>Orla and Fife's first forray into the history of the Fire Fey and their ruins they came across and unlocked the vault containing Bartholomeu. Orla using her royal crest was able to awaken Bartholomeu who is a loyal bodyguard who will defend her till his dying breath.</p>
				</br>
				<h4> Demonwing Debacle</h4>
				</br>
				<p>Despite Bartholomeu withstanding half of Orla's damage taken from Straoth he was unable to save Orla from Ahjani. He is now struggling with his confidence as a Royal guard.</p>
