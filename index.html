            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <div class="intro-text">
                <p>In the Kingdom of Attria, where the flickering flames of civilization and magic burn dimly against the encroaching darkness, one name echoes through the annals of history — The Bonfire King. Long ago, during what the sages now call the The Feyforged Dawn, this enigmatic Fey monarch emerged from the depths of the mystical woods and bestowed upon the indigenous inhabitants of the material plane a gift as enduring as the eternal flame itself — the spark of structured civilization and arcane knowledge.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="legacy">
                <h3>The Legacy of The Bonfire King</h3>
                <p>The legacy of The Bonfire King has since shaped the destiny of Attria, guiding its denizens into a realm of tradition and wonder, even as the age of magic wanes. The hearth of civilization he ignited flickers with an underlying turmoil, for not all who covet the flames seek to kindle them for the greater good. Political intrigue weaves its intricate web, as rival factions vie for control over The Bonfire King's lineage and the secrets it guards.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="present-day">
                <h3>In the Present Day</h3>
                <p>In the present day, Attria stands as a testament to that enduring legacy, a low-magic fantasy world where embers of mystical prowess still smolder in the hands of the few, while the light of knowledge casts its faint glow over the realms. In this setting/module, you shall embark on a journey into the heart of Attria, where the stories of The Bonfire King and his descendants continue to burn brightly. Venture forth to uncover ancient secrets, confront age-old adversaries, and rekindle the flame of legend. Here, you shall become not just heroes but torchbearers, wielding the fire of The Bonfire King's legacy to shape the destiny of Attria amidst the shadows of political intrigue. Prepare to immerse yourself in a world where the embers of magic mingle with the shadows of the past, for in Attria, the tales of yore are not forgotten, and the fires of adventure burn eternally. The journey begins, as it always has, with The Bonfire King.</p>
